That required using thinner card stock with no gloss layer, and coming up with a folding mechanism to hold the wings of the plane in place while folded up.</p>"

						"body": "<p>In creating our UI/UX codebase, we were influenced greatly by <a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\" target=\"_blank\">atomic design</a> principles. We broke down every element into the smallest possible chunks of code, then built them back up as context-free as possible.</p><p>This technique allowed us to build a library of pieces we could reuse across the app to assemble our more complex components, while keeping our CSS small and maintainable. It also made testing for 508 compliance much easier, as most of the atomic parts' compliance scaled up into the larger components regardless of how we combined them.</p>"
